# ALOHA AMIGAS!

# Pamir Perdeci

On a quest to score an 850 on CodeSignal's coding assessment! In my free time, I produce and publish electronic music, and fantasize about being the richest man in Babylon from my CDBaby royalties. I specialize in AI-assisted app curation and rapid launch to market using React Native. I'm also experienced in AI content creation and language models. I love working with entrepreneurs and startups to help bring their ideas to life.

## Skills

- Ai assisted app curation
- Rapid development
- React Native

## Projects

### Speedrun Builds

I've started documenting some speedrun builds as a way to practice the rapid development method. This is an ongoing process that keeps me sharp on always looking to develop and ship faster.

### Robotic Process Automation

I love pondering about projects that involve robotic process automation or hydroponic no waste cities. I write these ideas down in a potential futures folder so I can spend most of my time focused on the main thing I'm solving.

## Technologies I'm Excited to Learn

- Three.js
- .NET MAUI
- Arduino (with Mark Robber's Arduino Course)
- Python Automation
- Printing Stickers
- Engineering a PET printer & Recycler for homeless shelters
