In the land of technology,
Where machines and code reign supreme,
Deep mind engineers work their craft,
To create products that are pure magic.

Their minds are sharp, from conversing with 'DUCK',
They work with haste, they never waste,
Their coding skills are beyond compare,
Creating products that transport us somewhere.

With the power of AI and machine learning,
They create products that keep us yearning,
Like wizards in Hogwarts, they cast their spell,
Creating products that make us dwell.

From the depths of their creative minds,
They create products that are truly divine,
Like the magic of Disney or Harry Potter's wand,
They create products that take us beyond!

Their speedrun skills are truly amazing,
Their coding skills are simply blazing,
Their products are like original motion pictures,
Filled with magic, wonder, and adventure.

So let's give a round of applause,
For these engineers who work without pause,
For their magic, intelligence, and passion,
And the App's are SMASHIN!

On a quest to score an 850 on CodeSignal's coding assessment! In my free time, I produce and publish electronic music, and fantasize about being the richest man in Babylon from my CDBaby royalties. I specialize in AI-assisted app curation and rapid launch to market using React Native. I'm also experienced in AI content creation and language models. I love working with entrepreneurs and startups to help bring their ideas to life.

## Skills

- Ai assisted app curation
- Rapid development
- React Native
- AI content creation
- Language models

## Projects

### Speedrun Builds

I've started documenting some speedrun builds as a way to practice the rapid development method. This is an ongoing process that keeps me sharp on always looking to develop and ship faster.

### Robotic Process Automation

I love pondering about projects that involve robotic process automation or hydroponic no waste cities. I write these ideas down in a potential futures folder so I can spend most of my time focused on the main thing I'm solving.

## Technologies I'm Excited to Learn

- Three.js
- .NET MAUI
- Arduino (with Mark Robber's Arduino Course)
- Python Automation
- Printing Stickers
- Engineering a PET printer & Recycler for homeless shelters
