# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹


On a quest to score an 850 on CodeSignal's coding assesment! 
In my free time I like to produce and publish electronic music,

and fantacise being the richest man in Babylon from my CDBaby royalties.
Also obsessed with Ai assisted app curation and rapid launch to market using React Native & .NET MAUI.

The speed at which I can turn an idea into a working app is important to me and it's the one tree I kick over and over to get better at.
I've started documenting some speedrun builds as a way to practice the rapid development method. 

I've found AI to be crucial for increasing development speed and view it as an essential use it or get left behind kind of tool.
My passion for engineering things goes beyond the computer realm. I love ponering about projects that envoles robotic process automation or 

hydroponic no waste cities.(Inspired by Joost Baker)

I'm also experienced in AI content creation and language models. 
I like to hang out with and get best with entrepreneurs, indie hackers and underdog startup teams.



Technologies I'm dying to learn after completing my current obsession has been resolved:

Three.js
.NET MAUI
arduino - wit Mark Robber's Arduino Course
Python Automation
Printing Stickers
Engineering a PET printer & Recycler for homeless shelters
