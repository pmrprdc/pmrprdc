# ALLOHA AMIGOS! 


On a quest to score an 850 on CodeSignal's coding assesment! 
In my free time I like to produce and publish electronic music,

and fantacise being the richest man in Babylon from my CDBaby royalties.
Also love exploring Ai assisted app curation and finding the fastest technology stack to launch to markets using React Native & .NET MAUI.

Speed to market is the capability that is important to me and it's the one tree I kick over and over to get better at.
It's important to not get caught up in the technology but the excitement and feeling of momentum that comes with Rapid development is the competitive edge by all ventures to more easily  lead their team to their vision.

I've started documenting some speedrun builds as a way to practice the rapid development method. [ai assised]
This is an ongoing process that keeps me sharp on always looking to develop and ship faster.

I've found AI tools to be crucial for increasing development speed and view them as an essential part of my ongoing experiments.
My passion for engineering things goes beyond the computer realm. 

I love ponering about projects that envoles robotic process automation or 
hydroponic no waste cities.

I write these ideas down in a potential futures folder so I can spend most of my time focused on the main thing I'm solving.
I'm also getting in AI content creation and language models and enjoying learning about the world and myself in the process.

I tend to get along especially well with disruptive internet entreprenours, indie hackers and hungry startup teams.
Technologies I'm dying to learn after completing my current obsession has been resolved:

Three.js
.NET MAUI
arduino - wit Mark Robber's Arduino Course
Python Automation
Printing Stickers
Engineering a PET printer & Recycler for homeless shelters
